[NOTE: intalling this code as a package is not yet available but is coming soon!] Either install with pip (see this [helpful](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) guide for using pip if you are unfamiliar) by using this bit of text `python3 -m pip install \"PyThermo\"`, or co-locate the various files (\"constants.py\", \"crystal.py\", \"tT_model.py\", and \"tT_path.py\") found in \\src with this notebook. Below I include example code with both approaches.\n",

In apatite, 'flowers' corresponds to the damage-diffusivity relationship of Flowers et al. (2009) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.01.015), and 'ketcham' corresponds to the apatite fission track annealing kinetics of Ketcham et al. (2007) (https://doi.org/10.2138/am.2007.2281). In zircon, 'guenthner' corresponds to the damage-diffusivity relationship of Guenthner et al. (2013) (https://doi.org/10.2475/03.2013.01), and 'guenthner' corresponds to the zircon fission track annealing kinetics as derived in the same publication.\n",
