    "The most straight-forward application of PyThermo is in forward modeling apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He dates. First, set-up the PyThermo package. You can do this one of two ways. Either install with pip (see this [helpful](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) guide for using pip if you are unfamiliar) by using this bit of text `pip install pythermo`, or co-locate the folder `/src` with its various files (`__int__.py`,`constants.py`, `crystal.py`, `tT_model.py`, and `tT_path.py`) within the same directory as this notebook. Below I include example code with both approaches.\n",

(2009) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.01.015), and 'ketcham' corresponds to the apatite fission track annealing kinetics of Ketcham et al. (2007) (https://doi.org/10.2138/am.2007.2281). In zircon, 'guenthner' corresponds to the damage-diffusivity relationship of Guenthner et al. (2013) (https://doi.org/10.2475/03.2013.01), and 'guenthner' corresponds to the zircon fission track annealing kinetics as derived in the same publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The 'age' and 'error' columns are currently placeholders and are __not__ used in the forward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If you want a straight-forward approach to modeling based on eU, you can enter 0's for the Th and Sm columns. Note that there will be some minor discrepancy here when comparing to measured data as the Th and Sm alpha ejection lengths are different than U.\n",
